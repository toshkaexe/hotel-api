# Back end skeleton application

This is a skeleton Spring Boot back-end which needs to be extended to provide the front-end with relevant 
Pok√©mon data through an appropriate set of HTTP REST endpoints.

# Running the application

To run the application, execute the following Maven command on the command line:

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Alternatively, you can execute the ``main`` method of the ``hotel.PokemonApiApplication`` class
from within your IDE.

# Consuming the example GET endpoint

Once the application has started successfully (i.e., the message ``Started PokemonApiApplication...`` has appeared in the output),
go to [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) and you should see the String ``Hello from Spring Boot!`` displayed in your browser.
